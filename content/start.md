# Getting Started

The fastest way to get started with writing Ema app is as follows:

1. [Install Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) (see [platform-specific notes here](https://neuron.zettel.page/install))
1. [Enable Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes)
1. Clone [the template repository](https://github.com/srid/ema-docs) locally
1. Run `bin/run` and access the site at http://localhost:9001
